        <h2>üåÆ Projects </h2>

        <h3>Drone BAsed Face Recognition System</h3>
        <p>
          Utilizing MTCNN and FaceNet technologies, combines real-time face detection with deep learning for unique facial feature extraction. In this model training and testing comparison has been done with other models like HOG and YELLOW, the testing accuracy when used a simulation of drone is obtained to be 98.89% which is nhigher as compared to other models based on Convolutional Neural Networks(CNNs).
        </p>
        <h3>FLASK - CRUD operation API</h3>
        <p>
          esigned and developed the backend of a web application for performing all the CRUD operations and created multiple end points for GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, using flask framework and REST Api.
        </p>
        <h3>Air Canvas Real Time Screen</h3>
        <p>
          This Air-Canvas is constructed using open-cv and implementation of machine learning has been done in order to draw on the computer screen in real time.
